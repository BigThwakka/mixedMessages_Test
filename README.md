# Randomised Movie Quote Message Generator
A portfolio made for the CodeAcademy Full Stack Developer Path

## Prerequisites:
    * Javascript
    * Git (Git Bash)
    * NodeJS

## Initial Idea
The first idea was to create a series of strings that would be read with the String indexOf, LastIndexOf and Split Methods so it can be stored and randomised into an array, but I figured it would be too time consuming for such a small program so I stored the quotes in their own Arrays to make the randomisation process easier.
